There are several security steps that could be added to this web application to make it more secure, including:

Implement HTTPS: Using HTTPS to encrypt data in transit is essential to ensure that data is not intercepted or modified during transmission. HTTPS can be implemented using a free SSL/TLS certificate from Let's Encrypt or a paid certificate from a trusted certificate authority.

Use AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF): AWS WAF provides protection against common web-based attacks like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and others. It can be configured to allow only valid requests to your web application, blocking known malicious traffic.

Implement AWS CloudTrail: CloudTrail can help provide visibility into the activities in your AWS account. By monitoring CloudTrail logs, you can identify potential security threats or incidents and respond quickly.

Use IAM Roles and Policies: IAM Roles and Policies can be used to ensure that only authorized users and services can access AWS resources. Roles should be created with the minimum permissions necessary to perform their intended function.

Use Security Groups and Network ACLs: Security Groups and Network ACLs can be used to control access to your web application. They can be configured to only allow traffic from known IP addresses or networks, and to block traffic from suspicious sources.

Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Enabling MFA adds an additional layer of security to user accounts, requiring users to provide a second factor of authentication before being granted access to the web application.

Implement Server-Side Input Validation: Server-side input validation can help prevent attacks like SQL injection and cross-site scripting by checking that user input is valid before processing it.

Regularly Update and Patch the Application: Regularly updating and patching the web application can help protect against newly discovered vulnerabilities and keep the application secure.

By implementing these security steps, you can help ensure the security of your web application and protect user data.
